AlgoHub is a web application that leverages the power of OpenAI's GPT-3 model to assist developers in generating code snippets and solutions for various programming tasks. With AlgoHub, you can quickly obtain code suggestions, algorithm explanations, and problem-solving assistance by providing prompts in natural language.

## Features

- **Code Generation**: Input prompts for code implementation, algorithm explanations, or problem-solving strategies, and get relevant code snippets generated by the OpenAI GPT-3 model.
  
- **Algorithm Explanation**: Receive detailed explanations and breakdowns of various algorithms, data structures, and programming concepts.

- **Problem-Solving Assistance**: Obtain assistance in solving coding challenges, debugging code, or understanding complex programming concepts.

## Getting Started
